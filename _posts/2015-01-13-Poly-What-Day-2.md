So yeah….I’m definitely more tired than yesterday. Last night was a little difficult but nowhere near a caving point. My two o’clock morning nap was pretty bush-league, which left me waiting six hours to try again. I kept myself pretty preoccupied with some light HTML editing, reading, and watching some shows. However, my 8 o’clock morning went great. I doubt that I hit REM but I fell asleep quickly and awoke feeling very refreshed. I also have been drinking this bottled tea that is so viscous it moves around like syrup. It is hard to tell how much that is contributing to my uppity mood but I am not going to complain about. I have plenty more tea if that’s what Dymaxion Josh needs to operate. Mentally, I feel that I am still operating near capacity. Not knowing how to test this, I went ahead and jotted down a couple of the throughts bouncing around my head. Everything seems to check out…

 * Lemons shouldn’t have any sugar. They’re too freaking sour.

 - All roads shou*ld*be paved with bricks.
⋅⋅* Cracking eggs with one hand is fun.
* Ronald McDonald is a creep.
