title: French Toast!
---

French toast. There really isn’t anything quite like it. Who would’ve thought to dunk a piece of toast in some egg and a mess of cinnamon. Beats me… But really, I’m trying to think of something else similarly unusually but I’m completely blanking. There is something special about French toast. I’m just not quite sure what it is yet. I’m more of a pancakes guy myself. Although Belgium waffles are nice for hiding a stupid amount of fruit toppings, powdered sugar, syrup within its crevasses, you just have so much freedom in the outcome of a pancake’s shape and texture. Wait. Belgium waffles. French toast and Belgium waffles. It seems weird that only two out of the three breakfast-carb-trifecta names are preceded by some random European nation. Maybe we should be calling pancakes “Luxemburg delights”. Wow, that sounds way tastier than something that has caked itself to the bottom of some pan. But back to business. Let us take a step back…and then immediately dive head first into the great mystery of this toast from France. (Disclaimer: Any factual information about French toast will not follow. Only pure, unadulterated Josh talk. I look forward to taking this journey with you.)
